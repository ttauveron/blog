      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m working with multiple openvpn environments in Linux and while I enjoy working with the command line, it can be cumbersome to manage different connections through the openvpn cli.
My ideal VPN cli would be super simple : connect, disconnect and bash completion for everything.
As cumbersome + linux often leads to automation, my solution involves a little bit of bash :-)

      <description>Morpheus Neo, there&#39;s a Kubernetes api server available somewhere in 192.168.99.0/24, you have to find it to reach the pods.       Neo That&#39;s 256 addresses, how am I supposed to guess the right one?!       Morpheus I&#39;m trying to free your mind, Neo. But I can only show you the door. You&#39;re the one that has to walk through it.</description>

      <title>Deploy traefik in GKE using (L7) Google HTTP/S Load balancer</title>

      <description>Using Google Load Balancers in GKE Google Cloud proposes multiple types of load balancers and we can use those in GKE.
Usually, the first thing we do in GKE when we need to expose a service is to set its type to type: LoadBalancer. Under the hood, GCP automatically creates a Regional External TCP/UDP Network Load Balancer (L4) that gives us an IP address in Kubernetes to reach our service.</description>

      <description>I worked on an interesting challenge recently and I thought it would be nice to write a blog post about it!
A little bit of context first, there are two Google Cloud projects (which could be in two different organizations) and each one of those have their own network. A client in Project A needs to access an API in project B but this API is not publicly exposed for security reasons.</description>

      <description>Hello world!
My name is Thibaut, I work in software engineering, broadly speaking.
I&amp;rsquo;m specialized in DevOps practices and I like hacking around with various tech.
I decided to start a blog in order to document my learnings and talk about things I&amp;rsquo;m interested in, engineering being my main focus.
Hope this blog can inspire some readers!</description>
