      <description>Using Google Load Balancers in GKE Google Cloud proposes multiple types of load balancers and we can use those in GKE.
Usually, the first thing we do in GKE when we need to expose a service is to set its type to type: LoadBalancer. Under the hood, GCP automatically creates a Regional External TCP/UDP Network Load Balancer (L4) that gives us an IP address in Kubernetes to reach our service.</description>

      <description>I worked on an interesting challenge recently and I thought it would be nice to write a blog post about it!
A little bit of context first, there are two Google Cloud projects (which could be in two different organizations) and each one of those have their own network. A client in Project A needs to access an API in project B but this API is not publicly exposed for security reasons.</description>
